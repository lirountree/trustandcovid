# Association of COVID-19 outcomes with measures of institutional and interpersonal trust: An ecological analysis using national data from 61 countries 

Despite the importance of human behavior in containing an epidemic, formal quantitative analyses examining the relationship between trust and COVID-19 outcomes remain limited. We use data from Wave 7 (2017â€“2022) of the World Values Survey to assess the country-level relationship between trust and COVID-19 outcomes across 61 countries via clustering and regression. Our findings indicate that countries with low trust have significantly greater numbers of COVID-19 deaths (1200.63 more COVID-19 deaths per million, 95% CI [510.92, 1890.34]), significantly greater excess death (2289.14 more excess deaths per million, 95% CI [971.07, 3607.21]), and a lower vaccination rate (16.60 decrease in vaccination rate per 100 people, 95% CI [-27.65, -5.56]) than high trust countries, suggesting that there is a tangible impact of trust on country-level COVID-19 outcomes. We discuss differences between interpersonal and institutional trust and advocate for incorporating trust in disease modeling to better predict country-level outcomes.
